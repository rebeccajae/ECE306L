# ECE 306L Code
## What is this?
This should be all of the lab code for ECE306L. It may need some modification and is poorly documented, however this is what I have available that I produced during the labs. If I find any modifications at the end of this term, I will commit them and make a note in this document stating that I will no longer update this repository.

## How should I use this?
All of the resource files will be under `zips/content.zip`. This file contains all of the necessary binary files to execute all of the contained labs.

## Who wrote this?
Some of it was written by myself, however other parts were in the lab manual portions. I have not included those lab manual portions, and I also acknowledge that most of the contents of the `Lab3` folder are not my code. If I am requested, I will remove those files, however I am adding them here for educational purposes only.

## License
All of my own code, basically any `.m` files in a folder other than `Lab3` is my own, as well as the `part3x.m` files in `Lab8`. These are licensed under the New BSD license. All I ask is that if you use these programs that you attribute me by leaving the header intact.
